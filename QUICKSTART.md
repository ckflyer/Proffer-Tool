   - Make it Public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Upload your files**
   - On your new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag all files from this folder into the upload area

**Or Use These Simple Steps:**

2. Use any photo editor to resize it to 192x192 and 512x512
3. Save as PNG files
4. Upload to your GitHub repository

### Step 5: Add Ads (Optional)

1. **Apply for Google AdSense**
   - Visit: [google.com/adsense/start](https://www.google.com/adsense/start)
   - Fill out application
   - Wait for approval (1-2 weeks)

2. **Add Your Ad Code**
   - Once approved, create an ad unit (320x50 banner)
   - Copy the code
   - Edit `index.html` on GitHub (click the file, then the pencil icon)
